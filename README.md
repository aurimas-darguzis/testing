Test Types

In general, the most important test types are:

Unit Tests - Testing of individual functions or classes by mocking input and making sure the output is as expected.
Integration Tests - Testing several modules to ensure they work together as expected.
Functional Tests - Testing a scenario on the product itself (on the browser, for example) regardless the internal structure to ensure expected behavior.
